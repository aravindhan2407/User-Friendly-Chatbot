# User-Friendly-Chatbot
For each kind of query, a unique pattern must be available
in the database to provide a correct response. With lots of
combination on patterns, it creates a hierarchical structure.
Algorithms play a major role here as they help chatbots in
analyzing large datasets and reduce the classifiers and generate
the more manageable structure. Multinomial Naive Bayes is
the classic algorithm for text classification and NLP. For an
example, letâ€™s assume a set of sentences are given which are
belonging to a particular class. With new input sentence, each
word is counted for its occurrence and is accounted for its
common behaviour and each class is assigned a score. The
highest scored class is the most likely to be associated with the
input sentence. But chatbots are challenging to build because
there are an infinite number of inputs and come up with good
answers needs immense knowledge.
